This Java code provides a simple, terminal-based version of Tic-Tac-Toe for two players. The game initializes a 3x3 grid and tracks each player's moves. Players take turns to specify their move by entering row and column coordinates. The code ensures valid moves and checks for a win condition after each move. If a player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. This straightforward implementation allows for multiple rounds of play, offering a basic interactive gaming experience.

While this code serves as a foundation for a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game, it can be extended with additional features, such as enhanced user interface elements or computer opponents, to create a more engaging and comprehensive gaming experience.
